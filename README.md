## System requirements
This code requires CUDA and a Linux operating system to be executed. The multi-CPU and multi-GPU version requires MPI library installed.

The versions of CUDA and operating system we have tested on are:
CUDA Toolkit 12.4 and Springdale Linux 8 operating system. 

The version of MPI library we have tested the multi-CPU version on is:
openmpi-5.0.6

The version of libraries we have tested the multi-GPU version on are:
cudatoolkit/12.4, nvhpc/24.5, and openmpi/cuda-12.4/nvhpc-24.5/4.1.6

NVIDIA GPUs are required for running the program.
